We use PayPal to invoice you by e-mail. Your invoice is sent out at the beginning of your subscription on a per-semester basis. You can opt to pay everything at once or split up at your own discretion during your subscription period. After your binding period is up you will be invoiced monthly. _Note that transaction fees may apply._
