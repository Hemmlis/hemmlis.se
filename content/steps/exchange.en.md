Furniture  that have been rented will be reintroduced into our circular system where itâ€™s sanitized anew, and refeshed in order to be rented again. This way we create an alternative model for furniture consumtion which we believe will reduce the wastage of furniture and the following negative impact it has on the environment.

To succeed in this, it is crucial for us that our furniture be used responsibly. We put all out  faith in that you, our custimers help us out in this so that we can continue to offer you neat collections of furniture in the future. This we thank you for, fully hearted, on the behalf of our planet!
