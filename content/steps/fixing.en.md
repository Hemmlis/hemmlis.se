Our first task is always to sanitize incoming furniture with industry proven cleaning methods such as vacuuming, soap washing and steam washing, using environmental friendly products. This is particularly essential for textile furniture, mattresses and beds which we also treat with eco friendly methods. Subsequently we repair and upcycle the furniture when needed, by eg. repainting or repolishing.

Occasionally we reconstruct furniture or change specific parts completely to add function or aesthetically pleasing pieces to our furniture collections. Some of our collections can thus include completely redesigned items!
