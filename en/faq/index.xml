      <description>We deliver to your doorstep at a time that we both agree to. Help carrying it into your apartment is available for small one time fee. Your furniture pickup is included in the subscription! Our goal is to deliver the furniture the same day that you get access to your room. However, if there are many who are wishing to have their furniture delivered the same day, your delivery might be a bit delayed!</description>

      <description>The minimum subscription period we have is at least one semester (five (5) months). From a semester perspective, this would be until the middle/end of June (spring semester) and the middle of January (fall semester). Our other subscription period is for 10 months but is therefore abit cheaper! Delivery to your door and pickup is included in both subscription plans.</description>
