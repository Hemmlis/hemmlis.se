  <h3>The collections</h3>
  <p><p>Our collections consist of 5-6 different pieces of furniture, meshed together to create a uniform design concept. We invite our guest designers to the workshop to create exciting eclectic (mixed) design concepts ranging from vintage to modern or even nordic design and rokoko. Our collections are custom made for a student room of about 15-20 square meters and always leased as a whole.</p>
